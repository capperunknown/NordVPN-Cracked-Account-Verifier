# NordVPN-Cracked-Account-Verifier
Reads a text file with a list of cracked accounts then uses selenium to attempt to sign into the accounts while simultaneously storing functioning accounts and discarding ones that don't work

UPDATE: Nord VPN updated their sign-in procedure to include a re-captcha for protection against bots like this. This bot will no longer work unless I find a work around for the re-captcha. 

NOTE: All cracked accounts in this repository have been either deleted, secured or have had their passwords changed. None of these accounts work as of 2020-12-24
